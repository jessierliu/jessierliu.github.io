Speech is one of the most expressive and effortless ways that we communicate
 with one another. 
For those who are severely paralyzed and also cannot speak verbally, it can
 be difficult to communicate their needs and express themselves, which can 
decrease their quality of life, autonomy, and agency.
With recent advances in machine learning and neural recording hardware, a
 speech brain computer interface (BCI) could restore natural, effortless
  communicative abilities to these individuals.

Part of my PhD work focuses on improving and developing speech BCIs.
I work on developing speech production decoding algorithms using
 electrocorticography (ECoG) and computational approaches, like signal
  processing and machine learning.
I also work on more basic science research concerning speech production.

I have a particular interest in deep learning, unsupervised learning, and the
 neuroethics involved in our research.
