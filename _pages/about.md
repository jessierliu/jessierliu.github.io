I'm a postdoctoral scholar in the [Chang Lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF, where I study how we produce speech and develop speech brain computer interfaces.
I also completed my PhD in the Chang Lab through the [UC Berkeley-UCSF Graduate Program in
Bioengineering](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/).

Broadly, I'm interested in the neural basis of how we produce speech. That is, how **the brain plans and sequences the movements needed to speak fluently**.
I'm also interested in the intersection of machine learning and
speech neuroscience to develop naturalistic **speech brain computer
interfaces** (BCI) for those who have lost the ability to speak and cannot easily communicate by other augmentative methods.
My work has been featured in the 
[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/health/speech-brain-implant-computer.html),
 the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/paralyzed-man-can-communicate/2021/07/14/3a9ce638-e4b5-11eb-8aa5-5662858b696e_story.html),

 and more.


Apart from my research, I've helped develop software for [preprocessing and
 visualization](https://github.com/jgmakin/ecogVIS) of ECoG data, using the
  [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) (NWB) format.

Outside of research, I enjoy getting outdoors, especially hiking and backpacking.
