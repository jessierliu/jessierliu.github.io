I'm a PhD Candidate in the [UC Berkeley-UCSF Graduate Program in
Bioengineering](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/), advised by 
[Edward F. Chang](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF, where I develop
 speech brain computer interfaces and study how we produce speech.

I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning and
speech neuroscience to develop naturalistic **speech brain computer
interfaces** (BCI) for those who have lost the ability to speak and cannot 
easily communicate by other augmentative methods.
My work has been featured in the 
[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/health/speech-brain-implant-computer.html),
 the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/paralyzed-man-can-communicate/2021/07/14/3a9ce638-e4b5-11eb-8aa5-5662858b696e_story.html),
 [Science Magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/brain-signals-converted-words-speak-person-paralysis),
 [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/14/1016028911/experimental-brain-implant-lets-man-with-paralysis-turn-his-thoughts-into-words)
 and more.



Apart from my research, I've helped develop software for [preprocessing and
 visualization](https://github.com/jgmakin/ecogVIS) of ECoG data, using the
  [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) (NWB) format.

Outside of research, I am an avid hiker, Mt Tamalpais fan, and coffee
 enthusiast.
